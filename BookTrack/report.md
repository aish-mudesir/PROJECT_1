# BookTrack – Project Report

## 1. What I Accomplished
I built a Python command-line application that allows users to manage books and track reading progress. The project uses modular programming and file handling to store data persistently.

## 2. Challenges Faced
- Understanding how to organize code into modules
- Working with JSON files for data storage
- Managing GitHub project structure

## 3. How I Solved Them
I broke the project into small components, researched Python file handling, and practiced Git commands regularly.

## 4. What’s Next
I plan to:
- Add user authentication
- Improve error handling
- Create a graphical interface in the future
